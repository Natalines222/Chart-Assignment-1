      <p> Violence Interrupters in Coney Island have seen shootings in their community increase this year. Shootings overall are up across the city. Even though Coney Island has less shooting activity than Brownsville or
        Crown Heights, the seaside community have still seen an uptick. In June of this year, Mayor de Blasio announced a reallocation of funds from the NYPD to community youth programs whose goals are to try and prevent violence, like shootings,
        from happening. "Our education you couldn't get at Harvard," said Derick Scott, a violence interrupter and Executive Director of the nonporifit Operation Hood located in Coney Island. When asked what kind of experience would support a role as
        a violence interrupter, Scott says, "It's not something you can intellectualize." Scott went onto say that his life experience is similar to the experience of some of the youth with whom he works. Scott is one of the founders of SOS Save Our
        Streets, which started in 2009 in New York City. Following thousands of shootings across New York City between 2007-2008, Scott and others developed a program based off of the Cure Violence model that came out of Chicago. SOS Save Our Streets
        was so successful in the work they did that the city took notice and formalized the program. According to data from Precinct 60, gun violence has increased 500% from 2019 to 2020 so far. Violence interrupters hold a unique position. They are
        not law enforcement and they are not armed, and they work with police sparingly. In a time where the calls to abolish and defund the police have sounded again, the relationship between violence interrupters and police, at least in one section
        of Coney Island, isn't as contentious as one might think. PSA 1 Housing Bureau Police Captain Besemeh Rogers said, "Part of this is personal and part of this is a professional perspective. I'm very clear that in order to --I mean long term --
        in order to eliminate this violence that's happening. It has to be a two-tiered approach. It has to be a dual approach including both law enforcement -- and if you want to call them violence interrupters whatever the name --it's a critical
        component." </p>
